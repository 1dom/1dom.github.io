# About

I'm Dom. I've spent the majority of my ~30 years on this planet in/on/around tech, with a focus on the Web. My current interests include VR, AWS, security, programming, 3D print, smart stuff and general technical tinkering.

This blog was created with [fast_template](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/16/fast_template/), because it seemed like a quick and easy setup for Github Pages.
